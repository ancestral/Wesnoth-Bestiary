WHAT IS THIS?
This is a web site for browsing unit information for a free strategy game called The Battle For Wesnoth. (Not familiar? Check it out at http://www.wesnoth.org) Part of it is an experiment and self-learning to the wonderful ways of JavaScript, jQuery, and web design. As I continue to work on the project, it will eventually replace http://units.wesnoth.org.

WHY HERE?
Why not? I need a place that's publicly accessible online so I can make edits from various different machines. I also want to make it relatively easy for people to download the files so they can test and debug it themselves.

HOW CAN I HELP?
There are many things that need to be done, including:

* Generating advancement trees
* Creating a small UNIX program to parse the JSON output file into smaller files
* Fix AJAX issues
* Display and adjust images properly
* Create a unit browser for eras and campaigns
* Cleanup and optimize code

WHERE CAN I LEARN MORE?

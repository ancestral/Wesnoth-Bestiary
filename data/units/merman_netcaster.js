The improvisation of using these against soldiers proved very effective; most land-native creatures are already quite awkward when waist-deep in water, and getting caught in a net can render them nearly helpless.\n\nThe effectiveness of this method led to the development of smaller, weighted nets, which could be cast through the air; these were useless for fishing, but were useful in both combat, and in hunting game that came too close to shore. Clubs were used in combat with little or no adaptation from fishing, since they were already quite deadly.\n\nSpecial Notes: This unit is able to slow its enemies, halving their movement speed and attack damage until they end a turn.","die_sound":"mermen-die.ogg"}

They attack directly with their enormous mouths, trying to rip the flesh straight from their foes. Once their enemy is defeated, they eat the rest of the body, gaining strength in the process.\n\nSpecial Notes: The victims of this unit\u2019s poison will continually take damage until they can be cured in town or by a unit which cures.

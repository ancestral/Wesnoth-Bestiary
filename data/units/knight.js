Veterans of combat, they have seen the often-fatal results of a failed charge, and have learnt discretion in its use. Knights, therefore, carry swords in their armament, and practice tactics which, although requiring of much more patience, are less risky than a charge. Their lances are still at the ready, however, and growing experience with these weapons makes them deadlier at the tilt.\n\nSpecial Notes: Using a charging attack doubles both damage dealt and received; this does not affect defensive retaliation.","die_sound":"horse-die.ogg"}

They may serve in the armies of the world, but their first loyalties often lie with groups of their own making; secret, monastic orders that cross political and cultural boundaries. Rulers are sometimes wary of them, for the paladins\u2019 loyalty is only as strong as the liege\u2019s apparent virtue. This has led the more darkly ambitious to either attempt to defame and disperse these groups, or more rarely, to conjure elaborate deceptions to keep these otherwise staunchly loyal troops in service.\n    \nFull paladins are generally not quite as fearsome as the \u2018Grand Knights\u2019 that champion most armies, but they are first-class fighters nonetheless. Additionally, their wisdom and piety grants these warrior monks certain curious abilities; a paladin is very powerful in fighting magical or unnatural things, and most have some skill at medicine and healing.\n\nSpecial Notes: Using a charging attack doubles both damage dealt and received; this does not affect defensive retaliation. This unit\u2019s arcane attack deals tremendous damage to magical creatures, and even some to mundane creatures. This unit is capable of basic healing.","die_sound":"horse-die.ogg"}

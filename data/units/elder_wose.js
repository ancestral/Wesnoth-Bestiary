This is the greater part of why they are so rarely seen \u2014 standing in the slumber which they so often do, a wose of that stature appears to be nothing more than an oddly-shaped tree. Even a careless elf can sometimes be fooled.\n\nWoses are not warriors by any means, but their great strength can easily be turned to violence, should someone manage to raise the ire of these creatures.\n\nSpecial Notes: In woodlands, this unit\u2019s ambush skill renders it invisible to enemies unless it is immediately adjacent or has revealed itself by attacking. This unit regenerates, which allows it to heal as though always stationed in a village.","usage":"fighter","die_sound":"wose-die.ogg"}

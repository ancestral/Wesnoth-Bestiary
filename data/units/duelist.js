Duelists are so named for an unfortunately common practice of young aristocrats, for whom the sting of insult, whether real or fancied, can incite a rash demonstration of their natural right.\n\nExperienced fencers carry with them a small crossbow that is easily concealed under a coat or cape. Slow to load and sometimes thought dishonorable to use, it is in fact very useful, and those of their ranks who live long enough to be veterans typically do so by making such concessions to utility and survival.\n\nSpecial Notes: This unit\u2019s skill at skirmishing allows it to ignore enemies\u2019 zones of control and thus move unhindered around them.","die_sound":"human-die-1.ogg,human-die-2.ogg,human-die-3.ogg"}

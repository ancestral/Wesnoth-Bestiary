Clad in minimal armor, they free themselves to ride swiftly, faster than any of their peers. The daring tactics they employ are like a double-edged sword, for they often win either glory or a swift death. Lancers excel in hunting down infantrymen who have made the mistake of breaking formation, and in piercing defensive lines. However, they have limited use in defense.\n\nSpecial Notes: Using a charging attack doubles both damage dealt and received; this does not affect defensive retaliation.","die_sound":"horse-die.ogg"}

They are very rare, and were it not for the historical events, the singlehanded destruction of cities and towns that these creatures have wrought, they might be dismissed as mere myth. Legends are very specific about the ravages of dragons; noting their great strength, speed, their preternatural cunning, and above all else, the great fire that burns inside of them.\n\nBattling a dragon is said to be the pinnacle of danger itself, fit only for fools, or the bravest of knights.\n\nSpecial Notes: This unit\u2019s marksmanship gives it a high chance of hitting targeted enemies, but only on the attack. The leadership of this unit enables adjacent units of the same side to deal more damage in combat, though this only applies to units of lower level.","die_sound":"drake-die.ogg"}

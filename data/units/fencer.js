belong to a school of thought that considers the armor most soldiers wear in combat to be their own worst enemy. While armor can only soften a blow, evading it leaves the defender completely unharmed. Being able to reliably dodge any offensive move is a luxury only afforded to the fit of body, and then only to those who endure rigorous training.\n\nOutfitted with only a dagger and saber, fencers are light on their feet and useful in many situations where their armor-bound peers are at a disadvantage. They relish dancing circles around troops like heavy infantry, mocking the weight of their full armor.\n\nSpecial Notes: This unit\u2019s skill at skirmishing allows it to ignore enemies\u2019 zones of control and thus move unhindered around them.","die_sound":"human-die-1.ogg,human-die-2.ogg,human-die-3.ogg"}

While other races usually bear children singly or in pairs, orcs will have large litters of children all at once, causing their populations to explode rather quickly. Within any litter, there will only be one or two true orcs, who will grow to the full size and strength of their race. A few more will be half-orcs, notably weaker than their big brothers, and relegated to supporting roles in combat, such as archery. The rest, often a full half of more of any litter, will be goblins. Goblins are puny and quite frail, rarely growing past the size and stature of a human child. Goblins are born into a lifetime of near-slavery to their larger kin, and used as sword-fodder in battle. They thrive in spite of their tragic fate; in part because they are so very numerous, and also because their brother orcs are well aware how dependent they are on the goblins.\n\nGoblins perform the bulk of manual labor needed by the orcs, with the sole exception of jobs that require the brute strength of true orcs. Those the orcs revel in as proof of their prowess.","num_traits":"1","ignore_global_traits":"yes","male_names":"Badush,Bagar,Bagdish,Barag,Barbag,Bart,Bashnak,Bidish,Bidush,Bik,Bilg,Bilo,Binak,Bink,Biol,Birt,Bogar,Bogdish,Bogdush,Bogor,Bok,Bolg,Bong,Borg,Bork,Bort,Boshnak,Budush,Bugdish,Buk,Bunak,Bung,Bunk,Burag,Burg,Burk,Buurk,Eradash,Eradish,Eragdish,Eragdush,Eragor,Eranak,Erang,Erarag,Erarg,Erart,Erigdush,Erik,Erinak,Eriol,Erirag,Erirbag,Erirg,Erirt,Erishnak,Eriurk,Erogdish,Erogdush,Erok,Erong,Eronk,Erorbag,Erudish,Erudush,Erugar,Erugdush,Erulo,Erunk,Eruol,Erurag,Eruurk,Gadash,Gagar,Gagdush,Gagor,Galo,Ganak,Gank,Gaol,Garag,Gashnak,Gigor,Ginak,Ging,Gink,Girt,Gogdish,Gogdush,Gong,Gork,Gort,Goshnak,Gradash,Gragar,Gragor,Grak,Gralg,Gralo,Granak,Graol,Grarbag,Gridash,Gridish,Gridush,Grigar,Grigor,Grilg,Grilo,Grink,Grirag,Grirg,Grirk,Grishnak,Grodish,Grogar,Grogdish,Grok,Grolg,Grong,Gronk,Grorag,Grorg,Grork,Grort,Groshnak,Grudash,Grugar,Grugdish,Grugdush,Gruk,Grulo,Grunk,Gruol,Grurg,Grurk,Grurt,Gruurk,Gugdish,Gugdush,Gulg,Gulo,Gunak,Gurbag,Gurt,Gushnak,Hadash,Hadish,Hadush,Hagar,Hagdush,Hagor,Hak,Halg,Hank,Hashnak,Hidash,Hidish,Hidush,Higdush,Hilg,Hinak,Hing,Hink,Hiol,Hirag,Hirg,Hodush,Hogar,Hogor,Hong,Hool,Horbag,Hork,Hort,Hoshnak,Hudash,Hudish,Hugor,Huk,Hulg,Hulo,Hunk,Huol,Hurag,Hurbag,Hurk,Hushnak,Huurk,Pagdish,Pagor,Palg,Palo,Paol,Parag,Pashnak,Pidush,Pigdish,Pigdush,Pilg,Pinak,Pink,Pirbag,Podash,Podish,Podush,Pogdish,Polg,Porbag,Porg,Pork,Port,Poshnak,Pradish,Pragdush,Pragor,Pralg,Pralo,Prang,Praol,Prarag,Prarbag,Prarg,Prark,Prart,Prashnak,Praurk,Pridish,Prigar,Prigdish,Prigor,Prilg,Prilo,Prinak,Priol,Prirbag,Prirg,Prirt,Priurk,Prodash,Prodish,Prodush,Prolg,Prolo,Pronak,Prong,Pronk,Prool,Prourk,Prudish,Prugar,Prugdish,Pruk,Prunak,Prunk,Prurg,Prurk,Pruurk,Puk,Pulg,Pulo,Punak,Pung,Punk,Purag,Purbag,Purg,Puurk,Radash,Ragar,Ragdish,Rak,Rang,Rank,Raol,Rarag,Rarbag,Rark,Rashnak,Raurk,Rigor,Rik,Rilg,Rinak,Rink,Rirg,Rirk,Rodish,Rodush,Rogdish,Rok,Rolo,Ronak,Rudash,Rugar,Rugdish,Ruk,Rung,Ruol,Rurag,Rushnak,Vadash,Vadish,Vadush,Vak,Valo,Vank,Varag,Varbag,Vigar,Vigdish,Vigor,Vilg,Vilo,Vink,Virag,Virt,Vishnak,Vogdish,Vogor,Vonak,Vong,Vorg,Vork,Voshnak,Vourk,Vradash,Vragar,Vragdush,Vragor,Vralo,Vrang,Vrarbag,Vrarg,Vrart,Vraurk,Vridash,Vridish,Vrigor,Vrik,Vrinak,Vring,Vrirt,Vrishnak,Vriurk,Vrodash,Vrodish,Vrogar,Vrogor,Vrolo,Vrong,Vrorg,Vrork,Vrudish,Vrugdush,Vrulg,Vrung,Vruol,Vrurg,Vrurt,Vruurk,Vudish,Vuk,Vulg,Vulo,Vunak,Vurag,Vurbag,Vurg,Vushnak"}

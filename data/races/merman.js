{"id":"merman","male_name":"race^Merman","female_name":"race^Mermaid","plural_name":"race^Mermen","description":"Something like a fusion between humans and fish, the merfolk are an enigmatic race with both piscine and humanoid attributes. They have strong tails that lend themselves to quick movement in any watery environment while their dextrous hands and intelligent minds allow fine craftsmanship and toolmaking. Semi-aquatic by nature, merfolk can breathe both water and air without difficulty. Despite being able to survive on land, they are much quicker and more agile in the water and will rarely be found far from the ocean. They are typically wary of dry land, as they are awkward and clumsy there and they struggle greatly to move over rough or forested terrain.","num_traits":"2","male_names":"Absu,Abzu,Aigaion,Alastyn,Apalala,Apam,Apsu,Aremata,Atlahua,Atlaua,Barinthus,Dhakhan,Dylan,Elcmar,Ember,Enki,Faro,Habaek,Ikatere,Jamm,Jin,Kinilau,Kulullu,Labuna,Laut,Lir,Llyr,Ludd,Makara,Maui,Melicertes,Mimir,Natat,Nechtan,Neptune,Nereus,Nethuns,Njord,Nuada,Nudd,Nudimmud,Nun,Oceanus,Okeanos,Phorcys,Pontus,Popoa,Poseidon,Proteus,Raja,Rau,Rorua,Ryujin,Scylla,Sinilau,Sisiutl,Tagaloa,Tanaoa,Tangaloa,Tangaroa,Thaumas,Tikitiki,Tini,Tinilau,Tinirau,Toniwha,Triton,Vizi,Vodnik,Vourukasa","female_names":"Aglaopheme,Amphitrite,Aphrodite,Ariel,Atargatis,Calypso,Delphine,Derceto,Diktynna,Electra,Galatea,Himeropa,Jengu,Leucosia,Ligia,Lori Lamaris,Mama Wata,Marina,Miranda,Miriam,Molpe,Parthenope,Pelagia,Pisinoe,R\u00e2n,Sedna,Stella Maris,Thelxiepia,Tirgata,Vatea,Ved-Ava,Veen emo,Vete-ema"}
